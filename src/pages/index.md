## Getting Started

Buck.ai is built for Home Services Companies, a.k.a. The Trades. You need to use a Field Service Management software such as [ServiceTitan](https://servicetitan.com), [ServiceFusion](https://servicefusion.com), [FieldEdge](https://fieldedge.com), etc. to be able to use Buck Platform.

To get started, please email [support@buck.ai](support@buck.ai) so we can provision your account. To schedule a demo, please visit [https://buck.ai/demo](https://buck.ai/demo)

### Integrating Your Legacy Systems

Buck.ai integrates with systems like Service Titan. To get started, please check [integrations](/docs/account/integrations). Buck.ai typically needs 24 hours after the first integration to import the data and train relevant models. After that point forward, your data is refreshed in intervals between 4 hours to 24 hours depending on the data type.

{% callout type="note" title="What if I'm running on Excel?" %}
Buck.ai runs on historical data to optimize your business decisions. Hence, we need at least 3-6 months of job data to run our models running on a FSM software. So, if you're running on Microsoft Excel, we recommend you migrate to a FSM solution first.

## Basic usage

After the [onboarding](/docs/onboarding), using Buck.ai is straightforward and simple, without needing any extra setup. Buck.ai has different products for dispatchers and CSRs, however, it is build to enable you accomplist complex tasks with a few simple clicks.

### First Optimized Dispatch Board

Creating a dispatch board optimized for revenue and driving distance takes less than 30 seconds in Buck.ai.

From your app selector, select **Dispatch > Boards > + New Board**. Pick the date and the dispatch scenario you want to use. If you don't know which scenario to use in particular, you can move forward with the default scenario. Technicians in the scenario will automatically populate.

You may want to pick the jobs that will be included in the board, although it's not mandatory. Click **Create Board** and you're done.

### First Dispatch-Optimized Call

In the same manner, you can dispatch a customer conversation to the best -and mileage optimized- technician within seconds using Buck.

For calls, you either need a Buck.ai browser extension for call center, or you have to start the call booking screen manually. From **Omnichannel**, click **Calls > New Call**.

In _Step 1_, Fill in _Customer_ name, existing options will appear in the dropdown. You can also search a customer by _Phone or Email_. Pick the _Location_, and click **Next**.

In _Step 2_, fill in _Business Unit_, _Job Type_ and _Campaign_. Pick an _Availability Search_, and click **Find Appointment**.

In _Step 3_, Buck.ai brings the most optimal alternatives either for assigning to an actual technician, or assigning to an arrival window depending on the _Availability Search_ you picked in Step 2. Click **Select** next to the option you want to create the job. Alternatively, you can use the **Force Assign** button to create a job manually.
