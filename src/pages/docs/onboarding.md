## Getting Ready for Buck.ai

Onboarding to Buck.ai consists four steps:
  1. Integrating your FSM software to Buck.ai 
  2. Importing your data and Buck.ai model Training
  3. Training your team on Buck.ai 
  4. (Optional) Customizing your setup, rules and scenarios

### Integrating Your Existing Software

Buck.ai needs your historical data to be able to train our models and algorithms. See [integrations](/docs/account/integrations) to learn more and get integrated to Buck.ai.

### Importing Your Data

Once you integrate your FSM Software, your data is automatically imported to Buck.ai and a default configuration is created so you can get up and running within 24 hours. Once the data is imported, Buck.ai team will reach out if there's any additional information needed. For the training to go smoothly, data processing and all additional information should be provided beforehand.

### Scheduling Your Training

Once your data import and software is ready, Buck.ai support team informs you to schedule your onboarding training. Click here to schedule your [training](https://calendly.com/buck-automate/buck-ai-onboarding) with Buck.ai.

### Fine-Tuning Meetings

Once your training is complete, if you need to, you can schedule customization and fine-tuning meetings with Buck.ai support team, free of charge for up to 4 meetings.

## What to Expect from Your Onboarding?

Most customers get up and running within a few weeks of signing up with Buck.ai. The onboarding time can vary due to the complexity of your operation, or number of people/teams who will be using the product. However, Buck.ai support teams are known for their speed, so expect to have a meeting with them every 2-3 days during onboarding period.

### When to Expect Results?

You should be able to see the results immediately for call booking. However, we recommend using Buck.ai on a daily basis for dispatch ops, and the first difference in revenue and capacity should be visible within 60 days.

### Troubleshooting

If you stumble upon a problem and need support, you can email [support@buck.ai](mailto:support@buck.ai) to open a ticket, or reach out to your Customer Success Representative. Either way, Buck.ai commits to resolution of the issues within 72 hours max, as part of our SLA.
