### Only Include a Particular Job Type and Business Units

In order to avoid any ranking mix-up, create a particular job type for after hours jobs on your CRM. It will be automatically imported to Buck.ai. Enable your new job type and add your job type to your new after hours scenario.

Likewise, you can filter out business units that you only want to be a part of your on-call, after hours efforts. Add those business units to your scenario as well.
