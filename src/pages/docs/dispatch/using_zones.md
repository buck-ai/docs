## Zones Overview

A zone is simply a collection of zip codes where you can tell Buck.ai which business units/subgroups can be assigned to; or which neigboring zones can be dispatched together.

### Creating a Zone

To create a zone, go to Zones from the Dispatch side menu and click on __Add New Zone__. Type in the name of the zone, the zip codes that will be in that zone, and if any, neighboring zones that can be dispatched together. Optionally, you can select which business units/subgroups can be dispatched to that zone. ![Dispatch New Zone](dispatch_zones_add.png)
