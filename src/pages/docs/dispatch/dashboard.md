Buck.ai's DispatchIQ is built to empower you with AI, cutting-edge algorithms and predictions to enable you smartly manage your capacity. There are two boards on Buck: boards that are created as a result of scenarios, which represent a snapshot in a certain timestamp of your dispatch ops, and real-time dispatch board, which provides your dispatch ops as it stands right now.

## Managing Your Dispatch Ops
