## Adding Your Payment Method

Buck.ai uses Stripe to process payments. You can add your Credit Card (recommended) or your US Bank Account for payments. 

To add a Payment Method, click __Add New Payment Method__ and add your card/account details. The information you're adding is directly sent to Stripe for PCI compliance, without hitting Buck.ai servers at all. You can turn on _is default_ if you want this payment method to be the default method. 

Click __Create New Payment Method__ when you're done.![Account New Payment Method](account_billing_payment_method.png)

### Changing Your Default Payment Method
