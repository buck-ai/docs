description: How to Manage Your Users in Buck.ai?
---

User management is pretty straigtforward in Buck.ai. You can have users and admins, and each one has different permissions for using the platform.

---

## Managing Your Team

You can view your users from Admin Console/Users. To do this, click on __Admin Console__ from the app selector and click on __Users__ in the Admin Console dashboard.

### Inviting Team Members

To invite a new team member, click on __Invite a New Member__, and type in Name, Email and pick a role for the User. Once you click __Send Invitation__, an invitation email is sent to user's email with instructions to set their password. Once they accept the invitation and set their password, they can access to your account. 

{% callout type="note" title="Adding a User to Multiple Accounts" %}
A user who's already added to an account on Buck.ai can be added to another account without needing to set a new password. Once the user is added to the new account, the new account will automatically appear on the account selector in the profile menu, so the user can switch accounts if needed to.
{% /callout %}

### Revoking Invites

The invitation must not be accepted for you to be able to revoke an invite. To revoke it, click on the __three-dots__ menu next to the user and click on __Revoke Invitation__.

### Resending Invites

Sometimes invitation emails are blocked by spam filters and firewalls. In this case, it might be a good idea to resend the invitation. To do that, click on __three-dots__ menu and select Resend Invite. 

## Understanding Roles

There are two roles in Buck.ai, the __User__ and the __Admin__. Admin has access to every page, including the Admin console, whereas the Users can only create Dispatch Boards, or Book Calls, and not permitted to change any system settings. There's another role where you can define for your Users who can edit scenarios, and it's called Account Supervisor. However, this role can't be explicitly set in the Admin Console, you should email our support team to provision that user.

### Updating Roles of a User

To update the role of a User, click on the __three-dots__ menu and select __Change Role__. Select the new role and click __Submit__.

## Removing Users

You can only remove a user who has accepted the invitation. To remove a user, click on __three-dots__ menu and select __Remove__.
