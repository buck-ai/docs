Buck.ai provides a seamless integration to platforms like Service Titan and Twilio to facilitate data transfer and automation. Below you can find information on how to integrate your Buck.ai account to different platforms.

## ServiceTitan

Integrating to Service Titan is easy. First, you need to get your ServiceTitan Tenant ID and email Buck.ai about it. Once Buck.ai adds your Tenant ID to its app, you can proceed and generate the Client ID and Client Secret that's required to integrate your ServiceTitan account with Buck.ai.


{% callout type="note" title="An Easier Way to Integrate" %}
Instead of doing all the chores yourself, you can schedule a pre-onboarding call with a Buck.ai support expert to finish your integration within 15 minutes. Click [here](https://calendly.com/buck-automate/pre-onboarding) to schedule a 15-minute pre-onboarding session.

### Getting Your Tenant ID

To get your Tenant ID, go to __Settings > Integrations > API Application Access__. On the top right, you'll see your Tenant ID. Your Tenant ID must be added to the Buck.ai app on ServiceTitan developer platform, so that you can generate the Client ID and Secret required for integration.
