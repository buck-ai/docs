## Changing Your Account Settings

You can update your account settings from the same page as well. Update your account title, main account address and time zone here. Buck.ai also needs to know if you'd be working on US holidays.![Account General Settings](account_general_settings.png)

### Why Your Time Zone is Important?

Buck.ai serves its customers in 7 different time zones. So having an accurate time zone setting is important so we can display the times correctly on your dispatch boards and call booking recommendations. To update your time zone, select the correct time zone from the dropdown and click __Save Changes__.

### Working on Holidays

By default, Buck.ai rejects to create shifts for technicians on US Holidays. If you'd like to override this setting, select __Allow__ and click __Save Changes__.
