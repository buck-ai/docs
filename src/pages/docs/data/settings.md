Buck.ai automatically fetches and syncs your data every few hours. However, you can manually fetch your data as well.

## Buck.ai Data Sync Overview

Buck.ai is designed to work in conjunction with your legacy FSM software. To learn more, you can go to [integrations](/docs/account/integrations). After the first data import, your data is refreshed between 4 to 24 hours depending on the data type. 

### What are we importing?

Buck imports all the relevant data to job assignment decisions, including but not limited to the following:

  - Technicians
  - Business Units
  - Job Types
  - Customers
  - Jobs
  - Invoices
  - Tags
  - Technician Shifts
  - Non-job Appointments

## Fetching Your Data manually

You can fetch your data manually if you need to. Go to Fetch Data tab on your Data App and click "Sync All". ![Fetch All](fetch_all.png)
