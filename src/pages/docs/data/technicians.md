## Technicians Overview

Technicians list is where you can bulk edit your technicians or filter them based on certain properties.

### Filtering for Technicians

To filter technicians, click on Filter button on the top right of the technicians view. ![Technicians Filter Button](technicians_filter.png)

You can filter the technicians with various criteria: by which Business Units they are involved with, if they're Active on your FSM software or by if they're enabled on Buck.ai. Once you're done, click "Apply" to apply your filters to the technicians view. ![Technicians Filter Options](technicians_filter_2.png)

### Searching Your Technician Data

You can search the technicians by their first or last name. You have to type at least 4 letters to start a search. ![Technicians Search](technicians_search.png)

### Bulk Editing Technicians

You can click on the checkboxes next to any technician to start a bulk edit. Once you select multiple techs, "Bulk Edit" button appears on the top-right to allow you to assign the selected technicians to business units, or add them to multiple job types, as well as enabling/disabling them. ![Technicians BUlk Edit](technicians_bulk_edit.png)

## Technician Page

Once you click on any technician's name, or the "Pencil" icon in technician's line, you'll be redirected to the Technician page. 

### Updating Technician Card

If you have a working FSM software integration, Buck.ai wouldn't allow you to update the personal details of the technician. That information is fetched automatically every 4 hours from your FSM software. However, you can add the technician to multiple business units by using the business units selector. ![Technician Card](technician_card.png)

## Technician Shifts

## Technician Unavailabilities

You can manage technician Unavailabilities, a.k.a. non-job appointments, on Buck.ai. This features is turned on by default, but if you want to use your FSM's Unavailabilities, you can turn that feature on in Admin Console/Integrations/Your FSM integration.

### Adding a Unavailability

## Understanding Shift Data Sync

The shifts and unavailabilities you're creating on Buck.ai are simultaneously synced with your FSM software. Same way, the shifts and unavailabilities you're creating on your FSM software is synced with Buck.ai every 4 hours.
